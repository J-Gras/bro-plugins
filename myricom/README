Bro::Myricom
============

This plugin provides native `Myricom SNF v3` support
for Bro.

Installation
------------

Follow Myricom's instructions to get its kernel module and userspace libraries installed. Then::

        ./configure --with-myricom=<path to sniffer sources> --bro-dist=<path to bro sources>
        make && make install

If everything built and installed correctly, you should see
this::

    # bro -N Bro::Myricom
    Bro::Myricom - Packet acquisition via Myricom SNF v3 (dynamic, version 1.0)

You may run Bro as unprivileged user.

Usage
-----

Once installed, you can use Myricom interfaces/ports by prefixing them
with ``myricom::`` on the command line. For example, to use Myricom SNF to
monitor interface ``p2p1``::

    bro -i myricom::p2p1

To use it in production with multiple Bro processes, use a
configuration similar to this in node.cfg::

    [hostname-p2p1]
    type=worker
    host=localhost
    lb_method=myricom
    lb_procs=<number of processes, like 16>
    interface=myricom::<interface name, like p2p1>
    pin_cpus=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
    # Adjust SNF_DESCRING_SIZE and SNF_DATARING_SIZE to your taste. Make sure the descriptor is 1/4 of the dataring size.
    env_vars=SNF_DEBUG_MASK=0x3,SNF_DESCRING_SIZE=4294967296,SNF_DATARING_SIZE=17179869184,SNF_NUM_RINGS=16

Enjoy!

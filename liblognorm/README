Bro::Lognorm
============

This plugin aims at integrating liblognorm into Bro and is under development.

Installation
------------

The plugin is based on liblognorm_, which requires json-c_ (might change, see Notes
section). Make sure both libraries are available including their headers, which are
required to build this plugin. The following will then compile and install the
Lognorm plugin alongside Bro, assuming it can find the headers in a standard location::

    # ./configure && make && make install

If the headers are installed somewhere non-standard, add
``--with-liblognorm=<liblognorm-header-directory>`` respectively
``--with-libjson-c=<libjson-c-header-directory>`` to the ``configure``
command. If everything built and installed correctly, you should see
this::

    # bro -N Bro::Lognorm
	Bro::Lognorm - Log file analyzing (in development) (dynamic, version 0.1)

Usage
-----

The plugin wraps basic liblognorm functionality by providing the ``lognorm`` opaque
type. This type allows to parse log lines based on liblognorm rule files. In case a
rule matches, an event for every tag the rule defines is scheduled. To handle these,
one needs to define an event with the corresponding name. This event may specify any
subset of fields, parsed by the rule, as arguments. Fields are mapped to arguments
by name.

The plugin comes with a small set of scripts that allow easy integration. For more
details see ``scripts/Bro/Lognorm/``.

Notes
-----

 - The plugin is not well tested!
 - According to this `blog post`_, liblognorm will switch from libjson-c to libfastjson.
   Once this transition is completed, the plugin will need to be adapted.
 - Currently liblognorm seems to provide every value as string. Thus there is no implicit
   conversion to Bro types like ``count`` or ``double``.
 - The plugin does not support nested types (might be implemented on demand).
 - If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
